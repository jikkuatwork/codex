# Spec

- This is the repo of OpenAI Codex CLI
- I wonder whether it can be enhanced to be an MCP client
- docs for mcp is available in `./docs/mcp/`

## Requirement

Analyze whether it would be possible and do a report in analysis.md; with the
following:

- effort
- feasibility
- ability to extend with minimial code change
- suggest strategy (say, import the package & create a new one with mcp
  capability? or extend this?)

Note

- I would prefer if it can be done such that future changes can be pulled in
  easily & merged

## Loud Thought

- Looks like there is an mcp sdk
- I wonder whether it can be used to easily implement a mcp client inside codex
